# CA-Init-Container
This project consists a set of Dockerfiles aimed to override the /etc/ssl directory in other Docker images.
The purpose here is to provide a way to inject custom CA certificates into other images, without the need to rebuild them.

## How to use
Here's a docker compose example for extending miniflux:

```yaml
services:
  miniflux-certs-init:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/miklosbagi/ca-init-container.git#main
      # pick the correct Dockerfile for your main image (i.e. miniflux runs in alpine, so we use the alpine Dockerfile)
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.cert-inject-alpine
    volumes:
      # map location where the _ca.crt files are at (i.e. root_ca.crt, intermediate_ca.pem, etc)
      - ../_common/certs:/certs:ro
      # map the output directory, this is where the ca-init-container generates all the ssl certs, and makes your target container simply suck it up as-is.
      - ./config/ssl:/output-certs

  miniflux:
    image: miniflux/miniflux
    environment:
      ...
    volumes:
      # map the output directory, i.e. the whole ssl folder
      - ./config/ssl:/etc/ssl:ro
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      miniflux-certs-init:
        condition: service_completed_successfully

  db:
  ...
```

## How to tell if it worked
The easiest way is to look into the target container's ssl directory and see if there's a `generated-by-sidecar` file exists there. For example:
```
‚ùØ docker exec -it miniflux-miniflux-1 ls -la /etc/ssl generated-by-cainit*
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root             0 Nov 27 16:28 generated-by-cainit-20241127-162837
```

As such, the operation was successful, and the target container is now using the certificates generated by the init container.

### Troubleshooting
- If the target container is not using the certificates generated by the init container, check the logs of the init container. It should contain information about what it did.

## Using the correct Dockerfile
Ideally one would use the same base image that is going to be "enhanced". For example, miniflux is based on alpine, so the correct Dockerfile to use would be `Dockerfile.cert-inject-alpine`.

| For Distro | Dockerfile |
-------------|------------|
| Ubuntu | [Dockerfile.cert-inject-debian](./Dockerfile.cert-inject-debian) |
| Debian | [Dockerfile.cert-inject-debian](./Dockerfile.cert-inject-debian) |
| Alpine | [Dockerfile.cert-inject-alpine](./Dockerfile.cert-inject-alpine) |

## Caveats
- In case your base image has a modified ca-certificates.crt, ca-init-container will likely break it (i.e. it will replace it with the one from the certs folder).
- The certs folder should contain the CA certificates in PEM format, with the .crt extension. The files should be named after the CA they represent (i.e. root_ca.crt, intermediate_ca.pem, etc).
